# Lunar Tremor Tracking
Seattle Space Apps 2024 - Team name: Tremor Trackers

Sending continuous seismic data back to Earth requires a lot of power. Also only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful. We would like to program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about.  

In this project we write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!
